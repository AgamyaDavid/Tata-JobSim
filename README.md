# Tata - Data Visualization

This repository contains visualizations from the Tata Data Visualization virtual job simulation by Forage. During this simulation, I was tasked with analyzing a dataset to uncover key insights and trends. The process involved the following steps:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Ensuring the dataset was free from errors and formatted correctly for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducting preliminary investigations on the data to discover patterns, spot anomalies, and check assumptions.
3. **Creating Visualizations**: Designing and generating various types of charts, graphs, and dashboards to represent data findings clearly and effectively.
4. **Insights and Reporting**: Interpreting the visualizations to extract meaningful insights and presenting them in a business-friendly manner, often with accompanying explanations or reports.

The visualizations in this repository showcase practical applications of data visualization techniques to solve real-world business problems and communicate data-driven insights.
